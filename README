ignore-xend.so

When running with the RTM enabled glibc unlocking and unlocked lock causes 
a general protection fault. Normal glibc ignores those.
This LD_PRELOAD catches these faults and allows the buggy programs to run.

LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/ignore-xend.so program 

remove-hle.py

Remove HLE prefixes from a binary. Useful for verifying that a problem
happens without HLE too. First run without -p and verify the patch sites,
then use with -p binary to patch.

Warning: this can destroy a binary since there can be false positives.
Always run on a backup copy.
